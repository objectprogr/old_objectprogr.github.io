## Why worth it start from reading documentation?

I often started from writing code without reading documentation, because I'm impatient and I know about it ;)
By my impatient I have later many trouble even with basics things, fresh example with jekyll and my Personal Stack Problems.

<!--more-->

I started from instlled jekyll on Windows and in localhost default site work good, ok. I looking for simple theme, and I found this what I wanted 
 <br />
Ok, I instlled it and in localhost on my Windows I customize all. I was very happy so I created commit and push this to my github repository. What was my suprise when I go to [my website](https://objectprogr.github.io){:target="_blank"} and I see default layout without my earlier customizations. I lost a few hours looking for a solutions. Ok, I finded solution and I fixed this, but if I were first read [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/){:target="_blank"} it would save a lot of time. Finally ( already after basic customize my simple blog) I read whole documentation and I'm proud with me, I do not regret beacuse I have learned many very interesting things.

## First steps in Java

This same situation I had when I learn Java. I imaginations some project and I started coding without reading documentation. All things which I needed I looking for in google. Copy paste, copy paste and so was my work. Ofcourse I do not had no idea about basic things. If I find good solution to my project I did the copy and paste, but I do not had idea what does it do. Today I have very big deficiences in knowledge. Several times I tried understand what are objects, how to ues them. To this day I do not understand them, although I would very much like to. 
However I read a lot about Java (books, articles, tutorials etc.) and I must to state that many things I can't understand. I do not know what the reason is. Books for me are written difficult language to understand. Soon I want back to Java and I will describe my progress in learning, maybe this help me with difficult matters.

## Advantages documentation reading
+ we know the basics,
+ we know what to expect,
+ easier start,
+ know basics easier reading more advanced snippest of code,
+ **basics are the basis further learning**
